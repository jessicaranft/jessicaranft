# Hi, I'm Jessica Ranft 👋

- I'm a Web Developer specialized in Front-End, but I'm also developing Back-End skills.

- 🧠 I’m learning React.js, Node, SQL, Knex.js, and other related skills in a complete Web Development course.
- 💬 Ask me about HTML & CSS
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a former classical pianist and my side-hobby is creating music arrangements for piano.
