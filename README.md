# Hi, I'm Jessica Ranft 👋

I'm a Web Developer specialized in Front-End, but I also have back-end skills.<br><br>
🖥️ I started working as a freelance Web Designer/Developer at the age of 15 with self-taught skills in HTML and CSS, and continued working with that for the next 8 years.<br>
🧠 My main stacks are React.js for front-end development, and Node.js for back-end development.<br>
🎨 I love creating designs on Figma and transforming them into fully-coded websites.<br>
📝 I also create websites with WordPress.<br>
🎹 Fun fact: I'm a former classical pianist and my side-hobby is creating music arrangements for piano.<br>
